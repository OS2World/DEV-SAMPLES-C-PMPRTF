Abstract
""""""""

* Would you like to use the C standard function 'printf' in your PM
  programs for debugging, occasional error messages, etc.?

* Do you have existing subroutines, that use printf, that you'd like to
  use in PM programs?

If you answer yes to either of these, you may find the PMprintf tool
useful.  PMprintf comprises two parts:

  printf.obj -- an object file, compiled with IBM C Set/2, which you
    link in with your PM program just like any other subroutine.  This
    provides the printf service to that program.  You write printf calls
    in your C program in the usual way; the printf subroutine buffers
    the data (on a per-thread basis in multi-thread programs) and adds
    each completed line to a message queue.  For example, the following
    printf call will write a line to the PMprintf application and sound
    the Alert (bell):

      printf("This seems to work\a\n");

    Sample source (in C) is also provided for the printf function.

  pmprintf.exe -- is a PM application which sets up the queue used by
    printf and then "catches" and displays incoming printf lines.  It is
    a kind of 'monitor' or 'virtual console' which will accept lines
    from any number of processes that use printf.  PMprintf offers a
    number of options, including the ability to log the incoming lines
    to a file.  See below for a short description of the options.

    If PMprintf has been started then it will display the incoming lines
    from printf calls in other processes.  If it has not been started,
    then printf calls are quietly ignored (they return 0, not an error).
    PMprintf can be started or stopped at any time, and printf calls
    will then become active or be ignored as appropriate.

Sample source for printf (printf.c) is included in the package; this
offers certain customization options (for example, you can cause a
prefix to be added to the start of each line so that different
applications can have unique output lines, or cause lines to be broken
at a certain length). There are also some usage hints and minor
restrictions, documented in the header of printf.c.
